Assumptions made:
1. The integer shown next to the dropdown menu item for articles represents the number of articles
saved to a user's profile

What has been completed:
1. Test flow
    a. User signs in, checks the number of articles saved to their profile by looking at the number
    shown in the dropdown menu, adds one article, refreshes the page, checks again the number of
    articles saved to their profile

2. Confirmation that the number of articles saved to a user's profile increments by one after an article is added


What needs further work:
1. Refactoring of code
    a. Make signing in, finding the number of articles saved to user profile separate functions

    b. Consider making clicking on actionable items separate functions because most of those
    actions consisted of waiting for the selector or xpath to be recognized, waiting for the button
    to be visible, and clicking on the button with a one second delay (the delay is the amount of time
    to hold down a click on a clickable item)

    c. Placing functions in a separate folder

    d. Initialize puppeteer and browser instance as global variables

2. Fix the asynchronous call so that the test resolves correctly. Currently, the asynchronous calls
are not resolving as I expected. The test appears to fail, I believe, because of this. However, the
behavior of adding an article is working as expected.

3. Additional tests to verify that articles are able to be added as expected. The written test verifies
that one article can be added.
